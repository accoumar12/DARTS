Repo describing Differentiable ARchitecTecture Search (DARTS), a method used to automatically find the optimal architecture of a neural network.

During the ISAE-SUPAERO course, only the notebook `DARTS.ipynb` was written ; the other source code was used from the original paper repo to try (with failure) to play with the method.
